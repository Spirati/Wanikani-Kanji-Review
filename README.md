# WaniKani Kanji Writing Tool
This minimal webapp is a tool written in Svelte for [WaniKani](https://wanikani.com) users to help you better handwrite kanji - it will show you the meanings and readings of a random kanji for you to try to remember and write (for example, in a notebook or even in MSPaint). Once you've tried writing it, you can reveal the character to check your work.

## Setting up a development environment
Clone the repository and run these two commands from the project root:
`npm i`
`npm run dev`
And you'll be off to the races! Your changes will be reflected in real time.

## Getting started
You'll need to make an API key to log in to the application; this is used to retrieve the WaniKani vocabulary from your user data. You can do this [here](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/personal_access_tokens). Simply log in using this API key and you'll be good to go!
